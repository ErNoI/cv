Gathered a lot of data from the forklifts to provide the customer with statistics which offered an easy way to find improvements. During the time at Toyota a migration was started, the goal of the migration was to turn the current system into cloud-based microservice architecture. This work also included feature flags so the customers were able to work undisturbed without getting interrupted with the new releases. The teams were involved in the whole flow from building the new system parallel to maintaining the old system with responsibility of tasks working with both new development and testing.",
